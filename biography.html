    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>Keith Ngamphon McKenzie is a student based in Scotland with a keen interest in economics and data analysis. He was born in Bangkok, Thailand, to a British father from Aberdeen and a Thai mother of ethnic Chinese background. McKenzie spent the first seven years of his life in Bangkok before moving briefly to Spain, and later settling in the United Kingdom, where he began his primary education at the tail end of Primary 3. McKenzie’s multicultural upbringing has given him a broad perspective on global issues and a deep curiosity about how different economies and societies interact. He hopes to study economics at university, with a particular focus on understanding real-world economic systems and the policies that influence them. He takes a measured view of financial trends, expressing skepticism toward cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as investments, preferring to rely on index funds and shares of stock. In addition to his academic interests, McKenzie is proficient in R and Python, which he uses to explore data, model economic scenarios, and build his technical and analytical skills. This combination of economic insight and programming ability reflects his interest in applying quantitative methods to real-world economic questions. With his international background, strong analytical mindset, and dedication to evidence-based thinking, Keith Ngamphon McKenzie embodies the qualities of a thoughtful and globally minded future economist.</p>
