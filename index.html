    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Keith Ngamphon McKenzie</strong>. I was born in Bangkok and have been living in Scotland since 2016. My journey has been shaped by a deep curiosity and passion for technology, business and accounting.</p>
    <p>I am playing with two programming languages, one is Python, the other being R.  I use Python and R to test and explore data. I'm also using Python to create easy to use programs that allow others with no Python experience to do things with Python and certain libraries such as numpy and scipy. I’m doing this because I want to gain some experience so I can do my own projects; data, machine learning and predictions. I've also been learning everything there is to learn in Excel, as it is a useful tool for storing data and data analysis for Data Scientists and useful for preparing financial statements, saving statement templates and automated formulas for Accountants.</p>
    <p>As such, my main programming languages are <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong>. I am looking to start a data science or accountancy career in the not so distant future, hoping to to a university degree and progressing from there. This website is my little space on the Internet where I share my thoughts, projects, and ideas. Whether you’re here to connect, collaborate, or simply learn more about me and my projects — welcome.</p>
    <p>You can reach me at <a href="mailto:keith@mckenzie.page">keith@mckenzie.page</a>. As I am still in full time education, I do not want to recieve any job offers.</p>
    <p>Below is a list of featured projects. For the complete list of my projects, check out the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page.
