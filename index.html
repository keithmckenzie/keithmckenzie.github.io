    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Keith Ngamphon McKenzie</strong>. I was born in Bangkok and have been living in Scotland since 2016. I am interested in the science behind conputers and the field of statistics. I am also a tennis player and occasional golf player.</p>
    <p>I am currently playing with four programming languages, Python, Java, SQL and R.  I use Python to build projects to improve my programming skills. I'm also using Python to clean and explore data, and make predictions. I’m doing all this because I want to prepare myself for an undergraduate degree in Computing Science. I've also been learning Excel, as it is a useful tool for storing data and data analysis and useful for easy graph generation, and forecasting.</p>
    <p>Of the languages I'm playing with, my main programming languages are <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>. I am looking to start a career in IT in either data science or cybersecurity - if not in tech, finance - in the not so distant future. starting with a university degree and progressing from there. This website is my little space on the Internet where I share my thoughts, projects, and ideas. Whether you’re here to connect, collaborate, or simply learn more about me and my projects — welcome.</p>
    <p>You can reach me at <a href="mailto:keith@mckenzie.page">keith@mckenzie.page</a>. As I'm still in full time education, I do not want to recieve any job offers.</p>
    <p>Below is a list of featured projects. For the complete list of my projects, check out the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page.
