    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Keith Ngamphon McKenzie</strong>. I was born in Bangkok and have been living in Scotland since 2016. My journey has been shaped by a deep curiosity and passion for technology.</p>
    <p>I am playing with two programming languages, one is Python, the other being R.  I use Python and R to test and explore data. I also use Python to create easy to use programs that allow others with no Python experience to do things with Python and certain libraries such as numpy and scipy. I’m doing this because I want to gain some experience so I can do my projects; data, machine learning and predictions.</p>
    <p>As such, main programming languages are <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong>. I am looking to start a data science career in the not so distant future, hoping to to a university degree in the subject and progressing from there.. This website is a space where I share my thoughts, projects, and ideas. Whether you’re here to connect, collaborate, or simply learn more about me — welcome.</p>
    <p>You can reach me at <a href="mailto:keith@mckenzie.page">keith@mckenzie.page</a>. As I am still in full time education, I do not want to recieve any job offers.</p>
